# player
Minimax algorithm in Python for a two-player game, like Tic-Tac-Toe
minimax() recursively evaluates the game tree, considering maximizing and minimizing players at alternating levels of the tree.
game_over(), evaluate(), possible_moves(), and make_move() are placeholder functions that you need to implement according to the rules of your specific game.
Example usage demonstrates how to call the minimax() function with an example board state and depth limit.
